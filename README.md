# Iris-Classification---Deep-Learning

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for educational purposes. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is divided into three classes, each representing a different species of iris flower: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. 

The goal of this project is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features using a deep learning model.

I used Python and several libraries, such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib and keras, to run this project.

The model is trained over several epochs, achieving a high accuracy on the test set. The performance is evaluated using Accuracy metric.

This project successfully demonstrates the application of deep learning for classifying iris species. It highlights the effectiveness of neural networks in solving classification problems and can serve as a foundation for more complex models and datasets.
